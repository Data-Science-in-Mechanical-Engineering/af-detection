# af-detection

This is the code repository accompanying the paper "Robust Screening of Atrial Fibrillation with Distribution Classification".
It contains the code to reproduce all of the results of the paper.


## Usage

1. Set up and activate a Python virtual environment. This code was developed with Python 3.10.8.
2. Results can be reproduced by running the scripts in the `src/scripts/` folder. Running these scripts will output json files in the folder `results/`
3. Plots can be created by running the scripts in the `src/plots/` folder. Note that you may need to modify the end of those scripts to match the name of the file containing your results in `results/`.
